# Tim McCarty's CSIT 104 Term Project #

There's not much here yet. I plan to use PyGame or similar to make some kind of game. Ideally, I'd like to use some kind of physics written from basic built-in functions, as in Daniel Shiffman's [Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/). I'd rather not use Box2d, partly because I feel it'd be a project about using the Box2d API instead of showing my Python skill.

A few ideas
* Arcade clones
** Asteroids
** Pacman
** Flappy Bird
** Canablat-style one-button jump game
** Vertical shooter
* More complicated/original
** Rocket sim (2D kerbals)
